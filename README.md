# Indoor climbing

This website is a remake of my very own climbing project I coded during my SheCodes studies.
With more and better practices I recoded it.

The website is presenting why indoor climbing is a great sport.

The specific about the site, it changes theme. I used toggle, add and remove class in Java Script.

Process:
I add set up the initial folders, fill out the meta tags.
Connect the files, sxript in the end of body.
Add the font family.
Set up HTML sections and and add the html text. (image)
Add images to folder
